# Step 1: Plotly


Use the D3 library to read in samples.json.


Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.




Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.


Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.


Use otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.
